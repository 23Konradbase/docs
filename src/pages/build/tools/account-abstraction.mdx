## What is Account Abstraction?

Ethereum and EVM-based blockchains currently operate with two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and smart contract accounts. EOAs are what users use when interacting with their wallets and the blockchain. Smart contract accounts are controlled by code that was deployed onchain.

### Limitations of EOAs

While EOAs are extremely common they come with some drawbacks. For example:

* You have to pay fees whenever you do something onchain, which means you can't do anything if your account (EOA) doesn't have ETH in it.
* Your EOA is secured by a private key, which can be stolen or lost
* You can't build smart logic around EOAs like e.g. automatic payments.

### The Solution: Account Abstraction

Account Abstraction (AA) is a solution that:

* Enables you to build logic around EOAs, making them smarter and more secure. For example, with AA you can make sure there are additional recovery options when you lose access to your account.
* AA also increases the possibilities of what you can do with an account, like building a multi-factor authentication mechanism around it and improving UX by managing fee payments in the background.
