# Kraken Verify

Kraken Verify is a service that allows users to create an onchain attestation linking their wallet address to their verified Kraken account. This creates a trusted connection between a user's Kraken identity and their blockchain activity, enabling access to exclusive features across the Ink ecosystem.

Kraken Verify uses the [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://attest.org/) on Ink to issue onchain attestations. These attestations only store the wallet address and verification confirmation - no personal information is published onchain. Gas fees are covered by Kraken, making verification free for users.

Users can verify one address at a time, with the ability to revoke and re-verify with a new address as needed. To prevent abuse, users can perform up to 20 verifications per year. These verifications are non-transferable and provide a secure way to access verified-only features.

## Installation

```bash
  # Using npm
  npm install @krakenfx/verify

  # Using yarn
  yarn add @krakenfx/verify

  # Using pnpm
  pnpm add @krakenfx/verify
```

## Setup

### Remappings

Generate remappings for Foundry:

```bash
  forge remappings > remappings.txt
```

You might need to add this extra one manually if you're using pnpm:

```txt
  @ethereum-attestation-service/=node_modules/.pnpm/@ethereum-attestation-service+eas-contracts@1.8.0/node_modules/@ethereum-attestation-service
```

### IDE Configuration

Update your IDE to support remappings. For VS Code:

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "solidity.remappings": ["...=node_modules/..."]
}
```

## Usage

```solidity
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity 0.8.24;

  import { KrakenVerifyAccessControl } from "@krakenfx/verify/src/abstracts/KrakenVerifyAccessControl.sol";

  contract MyContract is KrakenVerifyAccessControl {
      // Only users with valid Kraken Verify attestations can call this function
      function verifiedUserFunction() external onlyVerified {
          // Your implementation
      }
  }
```

## What's Included

This package provides access control for verified Kraken users through EAS attestations:

- `KrakenVerifyAccessControl.sol`: Abstract contract with the `onlyVerified` modifier
- Supporting libraries and interfaces for attestation verification

## Requirements

- Solidity 0.8.24
