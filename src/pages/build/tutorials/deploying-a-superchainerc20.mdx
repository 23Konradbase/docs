# Deploying a SuperchainERC20

This guide will walk you through deploying your own ERC20 token across the OP Superchain using the SuperchainERC20 starter kit.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

First, you'll need to install Foundry, as the project requires `anvil`. Follow the [Foundry installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:ethereum-optimism/superchainerc20-starter.git
   cd superchainerc20-starter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pnpm i
   ```

3. **Set up environment files**
   ```sh
   pnpm init:env
   ```

4. **Start the development environment**
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Update RPC URLs**
   ```sh
   pnpm contracts:update:rpcs
   ```

6. **Configure deployment settings**
   Create or update your deployment configuration file:
   ```toml
   [deploy_config]
   salt = "ethers phoenix"
   chains = ["sepolia/ink"]

   [token]
   owner_address = "<YOUR ADDRESS>"    # Your wallet address
   name = "<YOUR TOKEN NAME>"          # The name of your token
   symbol = "<YOUR TOKEN SYMBOL>"      # Your token's symbol (e.g., "OPT")
   decimals = 18                       # Number of decimal places (18 is standard)
   ```
   Save this to `packages/contracts/configs/deploy-config.toml`

7. **Set up your deployer private key**
   ```sh
   echo 'DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=<YOUR PRIVATE KEY>' > packages/contracts/.env
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Never share or commit your private key. Make sure your wallet has enough funds for deployment.

8. **Deploy your token**
   ```sh
   pnpm contracts:deploy:token
   ```

## What's Next?

After successful deployment, your token will be live on the specified chains in your deploy config. You can verify your token on block explorers and start interacting with it!
