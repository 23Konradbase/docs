# Getting Started with Remix IDE on INK

This guide will walk you through deploying a smart contract on INK using Remix IDE, a popular browser-based development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.

## What is Remix?

Remix IDE is a powerful, open-source tool that helps you write, compile, deploy, and debug Solidity smart contracts. It's particularly useful for beginners as it requires no setup and runs directly in your browser.

## Accessing Remix

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. You'll see the default workspace with some example contracts

## Creating Your First Contract

1. In the File Explorer (left sidebar), create a new file by clicking the "+" icon
2. Name it `InkContract.sol` and add the following code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract InkContract {
    string public greeting = "Hello, Ink!";
    
    function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }
}
```

## Compiling Your Contract

1. Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left sidebar (icon looks like an "S")
2. Make sure the compiler version matches your pragma statement (0.8.19)
3. Click "Compile InkContract.sol"
4. Look for a green checkmark indicating successful compilation

## Connecting to INK Network

1. Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab (icon looks like an "â‰¡")
2. In the "ENVIRONMENT" dropdown, select "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
3. Configure MetaMask for INK Sepolia:
   - Network Name: INK Sepolia
   - RPC URL: https://rpc-gel-sepolia.inkonchain.com/
   - Chain ID: 763373
   - Currency Symbol: INK
   - Block Explorer URL: https://explorer-sepolia.inkonchain.com/api/v2

## Deploying Your Contract

1. Ensure your MetaMask wallet:
   - Is connected to INK Sepolia network
   - Has sufficient INK tokens for deployment
   - Is connected to Remix IDE

2. In the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab:
   - Select "InkContract" from the "CONTRACT" dropdown
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Confirm the transaction in MetaMask

3. Once deployed, you'll see your contract appear under "Deployed Contracts"

## Interacting with Your Contract

1. Under "Deployed Contracts", expand your contract to see its functions
2. You can:
   - Read the current greeting by clicking "greeting"
   - Set a new greeting by:
     - Typing a new message in the "setGreeting" input field
     - Clicking "transact"
     - Confirming the transaction in MetaMask

## Verifying Your Contract

1. Go to [INK Blockscout](https://explorer-sepolia.inkonchain.com)
2. Find your contract by its address
3. Click "Verify & Publish"
4. Fill in the verification details:
   - Choose "Solidity (Single file)"
   - Select the same compiler version used in Remix
   - Set optimization to 200 runs
   - Paste your contract code
   - Click "Verify & Publish"

## Tips and Best Practices

- Always test your contracts in Remix's JavaScript VM before deploying to testnet
- Use the Remix debugger to troubleshoot failed transactions
- Save your contract's address after deployment
- Keep your MetaMask wallet secure and never share your private keys

## Useful Features in Remix

- **Debugger**: Helps you understand why transactions fail
- **Static Analysis**: Checks your code for common issues
- **Gas Estimation**: Shows approximate deployment costs
- **Console**: Displays transaction logs and debugging information
